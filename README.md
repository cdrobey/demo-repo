## Building a Learning Puppet Environment
This project began as a plan to build a small environment for learning different facets of Puppet Enterprise.  The Repository allows you to spin up a monolithic Puppet Enterprise Console, and a series of agents quickly.  The environment is best supported by using templates of Redhat/Ubuntu Linux.  In the future, I plan to add Windows system as I find time.

## Install Code Manager
Code Manager requires you to configure both the PE consolde to define the Code Manager repository, and setup the client tools on your MAC.  Puppet documentation takes care of walking you through the steps:

1. Create a control repository for maintaining your environments and code.  Code management in PE uses your existing Git repository (repo) branches to create environments. Environments allow you to designate a node or node group to use a specific environment. For example, you could designate one node group to use the development environment and another to use the production environment. As you update the code in your control repo, code management tracks the state of that repo to keep each environment updated.

2. Set up Puppetfiles to manage content in your environments.  Puppetfiles specify which modules and data to install in your environments, including what version of that content should be installed, and where Puppet should get it.

3. Configure Code Manager (recommended) or r10k.  Configure Code Manager or r10k in the console’s master profile. If you need to customize your configuration further, you can do so by adding keys to Hiera. See the Code Manager or r10k pages for configuration instructions.

4. Set up a deployment trigger to run Code Manager automatically. You can also trigger Code Manager manually from the command line. If you are using r10k alone, you’ll continue to run it manually from the command line whenever you want to deploy. See the Code Manager or r10k pages for information about triggering Code Manager or running r10k.

5. When you are ready to run Puppet and enforce code changes on your nodes, whether on just a few nodes for testing or on a larger set, use the Puppet orchestrator command line tool.
